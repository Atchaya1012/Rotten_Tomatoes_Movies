# Rotten Tomatoes Movie Analysis Project

# Project Overview
This project analyzes the Rotten Tomatoes movie dataset to explore patterns, visualize trends, and predict audience ratings. 
By examining features such as directors, cast size, runtime, and genre, the project provides valuable insights for understanding what factors contribute to a movie's success.

# Requirements
=> Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
=> Dataset: Rotten_Tomatoes_Movies3.xls

# Features of the Project
# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
=> Handled missing values in key columns
=> Converted categorical and date-time data into appropriate formats for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
=> Visualized the distribution of audience ratings using histograms.
=> Analyzed content ratings, directors, and cast size with bar charts.
=>Created heatmaps to explore correlations between numerical features.

# Predictive Modeling
=> Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict audience ratings.
=> Evaluated models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.

# Project Output
=> Visualizations showcasing the distribution of ratings, cast/director counts, and correlations.
=> Predictive models for audience ratings, with detailed performance metrics.
=> Random Forest model achieved an accuracy rate of 38.74%.
=> Actionable insights for optimizing movie production factors to maximize audience appeal.
